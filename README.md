# Heart Disease Prediction Project

**Overview**
WHO announced that cardiovascular diseases is the top one killer over the world. There are seventeen million people died from it every year, especially heart disease. Prevention is better than cure. If we can evaluate the risk of every patient who probably has heart disease, that is, not only patients but also everyone can do something earlier to keep illness away.

This database contains 14 physical attributes based on physical testing of a patient. Blood samples are taken and the patient also conducts a brief exercise test. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer (0 for no presence, 1 for presence). In general, to confirm 100% if a patient has heart disease can be quite an invasive process, so if we can create a model that accurately predicts the likelihood of heart disease, we can help avoid expensive and invasive procedures.

**Project objective**
Our project object is to detect whether patients have heart disease or not by given a number of features from patients. The motivation of our project is to save human resources in medical centers and improve accuracy of diagnosis. In our project we used different methods to visualise data and trained machine learning model to detect heart disease by using Logistic Regression model.

**CONCLUSION / FUTURE WORK**
We use some libraries  provided by Python to implement this project. After creating model, the algorithm of Logistic Regression gives us the test accuracy, which is 81.96%. Though we get a good result of 81.96% accuracy, that is not enough because it cannot guarantee that no wrong diagnosis happens. To improve accuracy, we hope to require more dataset. There are many possible improvements that could be explored to improve the scalability and accuracy of this prediction system. In the future, to predict disease we want to try different diseases such as lung cancer and want to apply more models to this project to gain more accuracy.
